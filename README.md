## Five Domains
:eight_spoked_asterisk: Threat and Vulnerability Management (22%).<br>
:eight_spoked_asterisk: Software and Systems Security (18%).<br>
:eight_spoked_asterisk: Security Operations and Monitoring (25%).<br>
:eight_spoked_asterisk: Incident Response (25%).<br>

## The Exam
:triangular_flag_on_post: Around 85 multiple-choice questions
:triangular_flag_on_post: Around 5 Performance-based questions
:triangular_flag_on_post: Your score must be greater than ~750

### Exam Approach
:warning: Do at least 3 exam roundups.<br>
:warning: At your first roundup - Finish all of your multiple-choice questions that you can easily respond to and pass on the toughest ones.<br>
:warning: At your second roundup - Go all-in for the performance-based questions.<br>
:warning: At your third roundup - Finish all questions you've passed in the first and second roundups.<br>
:warning: Review everything if you still have time left.<br>
:gem: Secure the bag!!!<br>

### Tips for Multiple-choice
:warning: Define what is the call-to-action in the question.<br>
:warning: Be pragmatic.<br>
:warning: Focus more on the theory than practice.<br>
:warning: Don't overthink.<br>
:warning: Exclude the less reasonable options first.<br>

### Tips for Performance-Based
:warning: Start with the question you are more confident.<br>
:warning: Don't waste too much time when you stagger, just move on to the next question.<br>
:warning: Keep it simple.<br>
:warning: Define which domain you are dealing with.<br>
:warning: Baby steps - Starts with the easiest approach possible.<br>
:warning: Assign what you are certain first.<br>
:warning: Define what you are assigning can and can't do when excluding possibilities in a drag-and-drop question.<br>
